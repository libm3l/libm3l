Find.c: question how to treat word and search_term upon leaving - free???


When Free called from Rm,c  check that the pointer in the main structure is NULL.

		for (i=0; i<founds; i++){
			Tmp1 = Found_Nodes[i]->List;
			if ( (rmnodes = rm_list(&Tmp1)) > 0){
				rm_tot_nodes = rm_tot_nodes + rmnodes;
			}



1. check if pointer List is DIR or node. If DIR, can not use it in rm,
   find, add etc.

2. rm function, options --recursive (all items in DIR), --level (all
   items in dir at first level), --Number, --Size, --Type

3. Start writing helps for this function (groff mdoc)


5. KO this scenario:*  /*
     * can not remove this DIR, it is not empty.
     * this situation happens in --IGNORE if DIR contains items which
   are all ignored
     * and algorithm tries to then delete DIR
     */*         --------------------------- *  if((*List)->ndim != 0){
   /*
     * can not remove this DIR, it is not empty.
     * this situation happens in --IGNORE if DIR contains items which
   are all ignored
     * and algorithm tries to then delete DIR
     */
                        Warning(" Can not delete DIR, not empty");
                        return -2;
                    }*

      printf("Number of removed nodes is %ld\n", Rm(&Tmpnode ,
   "--recursive", "--IGNOR", "BBB_DATA_DADA", (char *)NULL) ); 



 6. KO args_num in long_opt call in Find c etc.

 7. Size_t int check for overflow etc.

 8. look for circular links and give warning

 9. Cat,c and Rm.c - optional parameter links to Found_caller function specifying how to search/remove
    linked data; either cat/remove link or target - need to be worked on!

 10. Find_caller - change reallocation of Founds subset. Right now, the subset is reallcoated every time a new
	possitive search is made; mybe allocate in chunks of ten or so and then reallocate to final field size.

 11. int call in recusrivelly called functions, should it be size_t if i is incremented upon each call?

12. When reading from TCP/IP or file, add M-arker to a link, read to a node and then update Link, rather
then removing link and making new one

13. get_arguments - need to solve how to indicate unsuccesfull error from the function. 
in Locator. c need to add testing of it


14. Cp - take care of LINKS

15. - add type to Locator.c DIR, FILE,LINK etc.
  nebo podivat se na to, jak mit vice parametru do Find - ie. --DIR --FILE etc. separatne pro target a source 

16 ./* NOTE - check that Tfounds and SFounds are identical
 */

 17.  if(*pc != '\0'){  /* NOTE - this condition added in this routine becase *pc increment is NOT synchronized with ngotten
 			so what happened is that *pc == '\0' while ngotten was still larger then 0, Need to synchronize it */
	the best would be upon each pc++ decrement ngotten--
